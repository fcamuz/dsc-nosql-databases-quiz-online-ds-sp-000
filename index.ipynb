    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "\n",
    "NOsql is good when realtional database does not work efficiently on the purpose such as storing chat logs. Unknown size and various attributes of a dataset can be stores as key:value pairs in nosql TYPE data embedded in the sql dataset. they have their own advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "storing a social media comment log can be better with Nosql. there is no set column numbers or data size. Also each coment might have their own comments reaion etc. A document type of data base with key :value pair  woul dwork better for such purpose \n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "____________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDM is a document Store that works as key:value pair which actual data is stored in value part of the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_____________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "in RDD main idea is splitting huge amoun tof data into multiple servers to get quick response. Fault tolerance is having back up all other servers on each servers in case of one or more are down. In such case, all servers run for their queries and then pull the back up of the down server and run that one as well so that thre is no missing data in the run. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "____________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of having each server run some query or function at the same time, and then combining the results is based on the idea of MapReduce, which is the secret sauce behind RDDs. When we ask each server to run the function or query at the same time, this is the \"Map\" step. When we combine the results from each server into a single aggregate, this is the \"Reduce\" step.\n",
    "Hadoop is one o fthe most popular Resilient Distributed Dataset that works with the mapreduce principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
